## ⚠️ DISCLAIMER

This project is under heavy development and is not by any means, complete. Due to the nature of the development process, the language is currently being handled automatically and therefore may not be accurate. There are many aspects of the project that may not currently work and/or does not directly reflect the technologies that the government has, currently, or will use.

## 📈 Project Management and Tracker

This [GitHub Project](https://github.com/orgs/PHACDataHub/projects/10/views/2) is current for DSCO in general although this will encompass the DSCO-experimental-web-app-platform

## 🤔 Problem statement that we are trying to solve
We have created a naming standard for all of our cloud projects. This naming standard allows us to track and easily identify projects and maintain them in an organized manner. This application serves as a tool to provide a user with a formatted version of their folder and project name, based on the project name they input.

## ❓The tech stack
In this current version, the application is built using React.
